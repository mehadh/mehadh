# Welcome!

:technologist: 

I am a backend engineer mostly working with Javascript, Python, and SQL. I often work with both Node.js and MySQL, and I also enjoy working with the [RAGE:MP](https://rage.mp/) platform. I am also heavily involved in pen testing and fraud research.

:floppy_disk:

Some of my pen testing & reverse-engineering work is not publicly available due to the nature of the content. If you're interested in seeing some of my private work, feel free to contact me. 

:construction_worker:

If anything I've posted on my Github is not working, feel free to reach out to me! I'd be glad to try and troubleshoot any issues or patch any bugs out. 

:mailbox_with_mail:

The best way to contact me is through email: mehadhamad00@gmail.com
