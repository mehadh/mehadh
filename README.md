# Welcome!

:technologist: 

I am a backend engineer mostly working with Javascript, Python, and SQL. More specifically, I often work with both Node.js and MySQL, and I also frequently work with the [RAGE:MP](https://rage.mp/) platform. I am also an avid penetration tester and fraud researcher, although not all of my work in those fields can be published due to its nature. 

:floppy_disk:

Some of my long-term projects are hidden in **private** repositories at the moment. If you're interested in my work, feel free to contact me for more information.

:construction_worker:

If anything I've posted on my Github is not working, feel free to reach out to me! I'd be glad to try and troubleshoot any issues or patch any bugs out.

The best way to contact me is through email: mehadhamad00@gmail.com
